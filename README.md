- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrMadium

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics. As of writing this, I have worked on my skills in Python, JavaScript, SQL, d3.js, Tableau, 
PowerBI, Mathematics, Statistics, C (not my strong suit), R, .ASP, CSS and HTML.

- 👀 I’m interested in Business, Finance, Marketing, quantifying human behaviour and insights that make a difference.

- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment - I can't see my bringing too much in terms of skill sets to anything at the moment. But I'll get there!

- 📫 How to reach me - @MrMadium on your socials.
